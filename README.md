===========

This is a mirror of [https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn](https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn) which automatically provides build artifacts for common platforms whenever a new version gets tagged.

**Branches..** The default `github` branch contains all the automation scripts needed for mirroring and building, the Dawn repository itself is all the other branches, and in particular [the `main` branch](https://github.com/eliemichel/dawn-mirror/tree/main).

**Update.** This mirror is synchronized every day at 5:20 and 17:20 UTC.
